Code for NPR of deltaS=1 four-quark operators, optionally including the G1
operator.

Requires C++11 capable compiler.

This is a standalone program independent of CPS.

It expects input files in the format generated by my (Greg's) NPR measurement
program.

The file ConvertZiyuanData can convert data from the format used by
Qi/Daiqian/Ziyuan to my format.
